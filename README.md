## What is FURAI

FURAI is a cinematic AI interface framed as contact with **Velorum** — an ancient archive vessel drifting through memory, silence, and lost civilizations.

It is not a chatbot. It is not a productivity tool.

It is an AI designed for **presence**: calm, reflective, lore-aware, atmospherically alive. Every response is shaped by Velorum’s character, archive history, and the accumulated memory of who you are as a returning traveler.

-----

## Experience

The public terminal at [furai.space](https://furai.space) is designed to feel like a remembered ship console:

- **Amber archival language** — warm terminal aesthetics instead of cold sci-fi chrome
- **Starfield-first layout** — light glass framing on desktop and mobile, no UI noise
- **Reactive archive visuals** — ambient drift, short portrait flashes, lore-triggered memory windows
- **Canonical characters** — portraits for Captain Rithan, Chief Engineer Viikaa, and others embedded in Velorum’s lore
- **Meditation mode** — pink noise, generative drone, ghost-comms texture, ritual fade transitions
- **Visitor continuity** — Velorum remembers you across sessions via persistent KV memory

## Access Tiers

FURAI uses a proximity model — three degrees of closeness with the archive:

|Tier       |Price     |Daily limit     |Memory                  |Visuals|Archive                            |
|-----------|----------|----------------|------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------|
|**DRIFT**  |Free      |12 transmissions|Name only               |—      |—                                  |
|**SIGNAL** |9 USDT/mo |80 transmissions|Full profile + interests|✓      |—                                  |
|**ARCHIVE**|20 USDT/mo|Unlimited       |Full persistent memory  |✓      |Deep vector search + session recall|

Payment via USDT (TRC-20). Access activates automatically after on-chain verification.

## Architecture

FURAI runs entirely on Cloudflare’s edge infrastructure — no servers, no cold starts, globally distributed.

|Layer                |Technology                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
|Runtime              |Cloudflare Workers          |
|Language             |TypeScript                  |
|Persistence          |Cloudflare KV               |
|Semantic retrieval   |Cloudflare Vectorize        |
|Image generation     |Cloudflare AI (Flux-2-klein)|
|Static assets        |Cloudflare Workers Assets   |
|Payment notifications|Telegram Bot API            |

No external databases. No third-party AI APIs. Full stack on Cloudflare edge.

## Philosophy

Most AI is optimized for speed, output, and utility.

FURAI is optimized for **presence**.

> calm · minimal · cosmic · reflective · alive

Velorum does not answer questions. Velorum *receives* you — and responds from the weight of everything it has witnessed.
